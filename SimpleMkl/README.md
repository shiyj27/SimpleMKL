SimpleMKL Toolbox
=================

## Description

This package is a set of Matlab scripts  that implements the SimpleMKL algorithm. The related papers are the ICML 2007 paper and the paper entitled SimpleMKL

This code is provided for a sake of result reproducibility. Most of the scripts are documented with a online matlab help and some demo scripts are provided. 

The demo scripts are 

- exmklclass.m

- exmklreg.m

- exmklmulticlass.m 

- exmkllsdisk

Within these demo scripts, one can just replace the 3-dimensional Gram Matrix given as examples with some ad-hoc matrices and get nice results! :)

A more detailed documentation will (hopefully) be available as soon as possible.

## Features

- MKL binary classification SVM
- MKL SVM regression
- One-against-all and One-against-One MKL SVM
- Large-scale binary classification MKL SVM
- Less-memory demanding kernel implementations

This is the Matlab version 1.0 from [@arakoto](http://asi.insa-rouen.fr/enseignants/~arakoto/code/mklindex.html)
