# SimpleMKL
This package is a set of Matlab scripts that implements the SimpleMkl algorithm which is run on MATLAB R2003a. The related papers is ICML 2007 paper and the paper entitled SimpleMKL.

This code is provided for a sake of result reproducibility. Most of the scripts are documented with a online matlab help and some demo scripts are provided.

The demo scripts are

     exmklclass.m
The "exmklclass.m" validates the accuracy of the algorithm on different datasets. Use different kernels to change the number of kernel functions.
